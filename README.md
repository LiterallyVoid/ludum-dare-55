# Triage and Motion

![Triage and Motion cover art](showcase/art.svg)

Game for Ludum Dare 55, theme: "Summoning" (which I instantly ignored)

You've only got so many turrets, so make them count. You can't move them once they've been placed into an arena, and you only get them back if nobody crosses the finish line. You've got to make the important decisions---fast.
